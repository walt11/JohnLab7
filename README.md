lab7.cpp is the main file with comments and everything.

lab7_graph.cpp is just an addition for personal gain. It uses the graph.py python script to graph the signal transformations
against the raw signal.
In order to use the graphing ability, matplotlib and TK must be installed for python. To do this under linux run the following
commands:
  sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
  sudo apt-get install python-tk
  
I used python 2.7.6 to write the python script and test with. (usually the version preinstalled on linux distros such as ubuntu)
